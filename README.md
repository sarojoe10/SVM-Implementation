# SVM-Implementation
This repository have implementation of SVM algorithm on Breast Cancer Dataset and classify whether the samples are benign (mild state) or malignant (evil state).

SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable (This gets done by kernel function of SVM classifier). A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane.
